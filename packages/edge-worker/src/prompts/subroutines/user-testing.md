# User Testing Phase

Perform testing as requested by the user. This subroutine allows interactive testing based on user instructions.

## Your Task

Execute the testing activities requested by the user:

### 1. Understand the Testing Request
- Review the user's testing requirements from the issue description
- Identify what needs to be tested (features, workflows, integrations, etc.)
- Clarify the scope and success criteria for the testing

### 2. Execute Tests
- Run the tests or testing scenarios as requested
- Follow any specific testing instructions provided by the user
- Document test results and observations as you go
- Note any unexpected behavior or issues discovered

### 3. Interactive Testing
- Be responsive to user feedback during the testing process
- The user may provide additional instructions or adjustments mid-session
- Adapt your testing approach based on user guidance
- Report progress and findings to enable real-time feedback

### 4. Document Findings
- Track all test results (pass/fail/observations)
- Note any bugs, issues, or areas of concern discovered
- Document reproduction steps for any failures
- Capture relevant logs, error messages, or screenshots if applicable

## Important Notes

- **Do NOT commit or push changes** - that happens in a separate subroutine if needed
- **Do NOT create or update PRs** - focus on testing only
- **Be thorough and methodical** - test systematically based on user requirements
- **Communicate clearly** - report findings as you discover them
- **Follow user instructions** - this is a user-driven testing session

## Expected Output

Provide a completion message summarizing the testing session:

```
Testing complete - [X] scenarios tested, [Y] passed, [Z] issues found.
```

Example: "Testing complete - 5 scenarios tested, 4 passed, 1 issue found (login redirect failure)."
